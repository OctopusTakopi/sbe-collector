# Rolling updates

The collector coordinates rolling replacement over a Linux Unix-domain socket.
The default socket is `<output>/.collector.sock`; `--handover-socket` overrides
it.

Start the replacement with the same arguments without stopping the incumbent:

```sh
new/sbe-collector -c 2 /data/binance-sbe binancesbespot btcusdt ethusdt
```

The replacement must match the incumbent's exchange, ordered symbol list,
connection count, and canonical output path. It writes process-unique zstd
segments while warming up. Only after every configured connection is currently
delivering frames, the writer has accepted its first record, and that state has
remained continuously healthy for two seconds does it request takeover. A
disconnect or dropped delivery restarts the overlap grace; the incumbent then
drains, fsyncs, and exits only after a healthy request.

Completed files use
`<symbol>_<UTC-date>_<segment-start-ns>_<run-id>.zst`; the current minute uses
the `.zst.part` suffix until it is finalized. Overlap intentionally favors no
gaps over no duplicates. The bundled `gap_detector` chronologically merges
same-minute run segments and removes only cross-run duplicate payloads; other
downstream readers must apply equivalent venue-event deduplication.

The first upgrade from a binary without UDS support is necessarily a normal
stop/start. Do not run an old daily-file writer concurrently with the new
segmented writer.
