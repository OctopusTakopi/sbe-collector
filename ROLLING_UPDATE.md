# Rolling updates

The collector coordinates rolling replacement over a Linux Unix-domain socket.
The default socket is `<output>/.collector.sock`; `--handover-socket` overrides
it.

Start the replacement with the same arguments without stopping the incumbent:

```sh
new/sbe-collector -c 2 /data/binance-sbe binancesbespot btcusdt ethusdt
```

The replacement must match the incumbent's exchange, ordered symbol list,
connection count, and canonical output path. While warming up it may write a
run-local sidecar (`<symbol>_<UTC-date>_<run-id>.zst`) if today's canonical
daily file is already locked by the incumbent. Only after every configured
connection is currently delivering frames, the writer has accepted its first
record, and that state has remained continuously healthy for two seconds does
it request takeover. A disconnect or dropped delivery restarts the overlap
grace; the incumbent then drains, fsyncs, and exits only after a healthy
request.

Steady-state recordings use one file per symbol per UTC day:
`<symbol>_<UTC-date>.zst`. During handover overlap the challenger writes a
run-local sidecar. After the incumbent releases the daily file lock (the
switch), that sidecar's finished zstd frame is appended into
`<symbol>_<UTC-date>.zst` and the sidecar is deleted. If the challenger exits
before the switch, the sidecar stays on disk. Overlap intentionally favors no
gaps over no duplicates.

The first upgrade from a binary without UDS support is necessarily a normal
stop/start.
