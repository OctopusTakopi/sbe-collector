//! Duplicate suppression for redundant websocket connections.
//!
//! Running the same subscription over several connections is what closes the
//! gap left by an exchange-initiated disconnect: while one socket is being
//! re-established, the others keep delivering. The cost is that every message
//! now arrives once per healthy connection, so exactly one copy has to be kept.
//!
//! # Why the frame is the key
//!
//! Every connection receives the *same bytes* for the same market event — the
//! exchange encodes each SBE frame once and fans it out — so the frame itself
//! identifies the event, with no need to decode a template-specific sequence
//! field before deciding whether the frame is new.
//!
//! Distinct events are never byte-identical: every SBE template carries a book
//! update id, a trade id, or an event time, so two different events differ
//! somewhere in the frame.
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! Keeping the *first* copy preserves the order of the merged stream. Each
//! connection delivers events in order, so for events `m` before `n`,
//! `first(m) = min over connections of arrival(m)` is earlier than
//! `first(n) = min ... arrival(n)`: every term of the first minimum precedes
//! the matching term of the second. The recorded timestamp is therefore also
//! the lowest latency any connection achieved for that event.
//!
//! The one exception is a connection that comes back from a reconnect *ahead*
//! of where a lagging peer still is: it can deliver an event whose predecessor
//! has not arrived on any connection yet. The depth continuity check treats
//! that as a gap and refetches a snapshot, which is the correct repair.
